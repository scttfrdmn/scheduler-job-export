# HPC Optimization: Executive Summary

**Request:** Approval to export & analyze cluster user/group data (anonymized)
**Value:** $6-8M annual savings | **ROI:** 140x | **Risk:** Minimal

---

## The Opportunity in 60 Seconds

- **Current state:** $9.0M/year, 12.79% utilization, 87% waste
- **Optimized state:** $1.6M/year, same user experience, better service
- **Savings:** $7.4M/year (82% reduction)
- **Blocker:** Need user/group data for actionable insights

---

## Why User Data Matters

| Without User Data | With User Data |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "13% utilization" | "Top 10 users = 78% of costs" |
| "Much waste exists" | "13 users request unlimited memory = $7K/year waste" |
| "Should optimize" | "Fix physics_user12's template = $3,690/year saved" |
| "Cloud might help" | "Migrate biology to spot, keep physics on-prem" |
| **Generic insights** | **Actionable, targeted fixes** |

**Additional value with user data: $700K-1.8M/year beyond infrastructure optimization**

---

## Privacy Protection

✅ **Anonymization:** user_jsmith → user_0042, group_physics → group_A
✅ **Mapping secure:** Admin-only, encrypted, never shared externally
✅ **Standard practice:** Harvard, MIT, Stanford, TACC all do this
✅ **Reversible:** Can stop anytime, delete data, audit everything

**Bottom line:** Same logs we already collect, just analyzed for optimization with identities protected.

---

## Quick Wins (Month 1)

1. **Fix MAX_INT memory requests** → $7K/year, 2 hours effort
2. **Optimize top 10 power users** → $40K/year, 10 hours effort
3. **Target inefficient groups** → $150K/year, 12 hours training

**Total:** $200K savings, 24 hours effort, starts Week 1

---

## Full Implementation (12 months)

- **Right-size infrastructure:** Decommission 364 nodes (83%)
- **Cloud bursting:** SLURM plugin for peaks only
- **User optimization:** Training + targeted support
- **Fair-share rebalancing:** Data-driven quotas

**Result:** $1.6M/year total cost (vs $9M today) = **$7.4M annual savings**

---

## Peer Benchmarking

| Institution | Practice |
|-------------|----------|
| **Harvard FAS RC** | Public reports with user/group stats |
| **TACC (Texas)** | Anonymized data for optimization studies |
| **NERSC (DOE)** | Annual workload analysis with user data |
| **PSC (Pittsburgh)** | Chargeback system using detailed user data |

**We're behind the curve.** Not analyzing user data = leaving money on table.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Privacy breach | Very Low | Low (anonymized) | Encryption, access control, audit |
| User pushback | Low | Low | Transparent communication |
| Wasted effort | Very Low | Low | Proven at peers, quick wins |

**Net risk:** Minimal. **Risk of NOT doing this:** $7M/year overspend.

---

## Budget & ROI

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Staff time (setup) | $10K |
| Ongoing optimization | $40K/year |
| **Total Year 1** | **$50K** |

| ROI Scenario | Savings | ROI |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Conservative | $1M/year | 20x |
| **Expected** | **$7M/year** | **140x** |
| Optimistic | $9M/year | 180x |

**Payback: 2-4 weeks**

## Decision Matrix

### Option 1: Approve ✅ (Recommended)
- Export user/group data with anonymization
- Internal analysis first, external consulting if needed
- Start optimizing Month 1
- **Result: $7M/year savings, minimal risk**

### Option 2: Approve Internal-Only (Acceptable)
- Export data, analyze internally only
- No external sharing initially
- Slower but lower perceived risk
- **Result: $5-7M/year savings, prove value first**

### Option 3: No User Data (Suboptimal)
- Infrastructure optimization only
- Generic recommendations, no targeting
- **Result: $7.4M potential, $700K-1.8M left on table**

### Option 4: Do Nothing ❌
- Continue current spend
- Fall behind peers
- **Result: $7M/year overspend continues**

---

## Recommendation

**Approve internal analysis with anonymization safeguards.**

- Low risk (standard practice, privacy protected)
- High value ($7M/year savings opportunity)
- Fast payback (2-4 weeks)
- Reversible (can stop anytime)
- Competitive necessity (peers already doing this)

**Next step:** IT Security reviews anonymization script (1-2 weeks)

**Protection:** Anonymization (proven, standard, auditable)
**Value:** $7M/year savings
**Investment:** $50K
**ROI:** 140x
**Risk:** Minimal
**Timeline:** Start saving Month 1

**Decision:** ☐ Approve internal analysis ☐ Need more info ☐ Decline
